# Concrete5 Tutorial - Programmatic Attributes
Concrete5.7+ example code for creating attributes and attribute sets programmatically.

## Installation
Copy the `attributes_example` folder into the packages folder in the root of your Concrete5 site. Then go to the Dashboard->Extend Concrete5 and then click install next to the Attributes Example package.

After installation, go to Dashboard->Pages & Themes->Attributes. You will find the Car Details Attribute Set and the Attribute Keys installed there.

## Notes
This is a slightly more abstracted function than is shown in the [Adding Attribute Sets and Keys Progammatically](http://documentation.concrete5.org/developers/packages/adding-attribute-sets-and-keys-programmatically) tutorial.
In this version, the addition of sets and keys are moved into their own function that can be easily re-used and which allows for installing all types of Attribute Sets and Attribute Keys.
